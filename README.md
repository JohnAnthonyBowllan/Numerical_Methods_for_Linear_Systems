## Linear System Solution Approximation

This repository contains an in-depth analysis of the derivation, convergence criteria, and parameter optimization of the Successive Over-Relaxation method and relevant precursor methods, namely the Jacobi Method and the Gauss-Seidel Method. MATLAB implementations of the aforementioned approximation methods and other relevant iterative algorithms (Steepest Descent and Conjugate Gradient Method) accompany this theoretical analysis.
Please regard the report and presentation for further details if interested.
